### Hi all ðŸ‘‹, I am **Riccardo De Benedictis**

I have a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering since 2010 from University of Rome 'La Sapienza' and a Ph.D. in Computing, Electronics and Mathematics since 2019 from University of Plymouth.

I am a researcher in Artificial Intelligence at the [Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies](https://istc.cnr.it/) of the [National Research Council](https://www.cnr.it/en) of Italy. I am a member of the [Planning and Scheduling Technology](https://www.istc.cnr.it/it/group/pst) (PST) Lab, a research group mainly focused on automated and interactive techniques for planning problems.

My [research](/research/) topics concern the development of automated reasoning solvers aimed at addressing real world applications, while keeping a strong consideration for the human component that must interact with the intelligent applications. Special attention is given to the *efficiency* of the reasoning processes, obtained through the development of domain-independent *heuristics* which, in an integrated way, allow solving semantic inference problems, planning and scheduling problems, as well as their execution and adaptation in dynamic environments.
